# Svelte Project Generator  
This is a repo I personally use when creating new Svelte projects ðŸ˜„  
I often want to get a basic boilerplate with some nice styling up and running as fast as possible so this is a good way of doing just that. Hope you find it useful  
  
## Getting started  
Clone it and install dependencies
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/BullishVince/svelte-project-generator.git && npm i  
```  
Create your project, run `npm run help` if you need help ðŸ˜‰  
```node
npm run create -- -l {location} -n {name}
```
